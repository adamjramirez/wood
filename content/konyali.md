Discovered another restaurant via Google, that cooks with a wood-fired oven.

Need to visit and give it a try. Their teaser on their site looks good.

**Konyali**  
Hasenheide 7 (not the one on Reichenberger Str. - they have no wood oven)  
10967 Berlin

UPDATE  
Konyali has now changed its< name to X, and they, unfortunately, have a gas installation in their previous wood-fired oven.  
The baked items from the oven were tasty but lacked the elements of a wood-fired bake.
