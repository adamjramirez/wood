Ferma Dacilor, located about 1h outside of Bucharest, Romania.  
Only serving naturally grown food, and cooking most, if not all, over an open wood fire.

They are working with a 30 hectacre plot, tending to farm animals, gardens and their own lodging for guests staying overnight.

Dacilor are definitely on my list of places to visit.
