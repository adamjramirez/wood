Hasir's is well known in Berlin for being the "first" turkish restaurant. We won't go into details on that here, but we will focus on their wood-fired oven at their Kreuzberg location.

According to their menu, 3 items are prepared in the wood-fired oven

1) Boneless lamb shank served with peppers and tomato  
2) Oven-roasted vegetables  
3) Lahmacun

The lamb was baked ahead of time, and _perhaps_ finished in the wood-fired oven. However, it lacked any sort of character that you would expect from wood.

The lahmacun, on the other hand, was spectacular. Small in comparison to many other places in Berlin, but powerful. A crisp underside, with a flavorful meat spread baked into the top side of the dough.   
  
The interior and service seem to justify the rather high price of 3x lahmacun (8.50€). I would personally visit Yeşil Firin again, before ordering another set of 3 for 8.50 at Hasir's.
