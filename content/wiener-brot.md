Wiener Brot bakery in Berlin Mitte is the only (as far as I know) wood fire bakery in the city limits.

Opened by celebrity chef Sarah Wiener, the bakery boasts purely bio, sourdough, wood-fired baked bread.

The crust and exterior of the loaves are precisely why wood-fired ovens are preferred.

The "Dinkel" loaf is highly recommended. A very airy and soft crumb, with the smooth flavor of Dinkel (spelt), and the incredible crispy, well-formed crust.
