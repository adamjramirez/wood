Yeşil Firin.  
Never heard of them before my first visit.   
They've been around for 20 years in Berlin, since 1999. That says a lot, with the "flavor of the week" food scene in Berlin over the last \~decade.

Located on Badstraße in Wedding (near S+U Gesundbrunnen), the first thing you see when you walk in the door is their wood-fired oven.  
With a smirk, the kind gentleman behind the counter let me take a photo of their oven.

They installed a custom wing in their oven to prevent ash spread.

I ordered a lahmacun and a pide.  
Not all lahmacuns are freshly made, but upon asking for a fresh one, they happily obliged.

The result was a crunchy-crusted, tender-doughed delight.

The team behind these baked goods, were so proud to show off their work.

Visit Yeşil Firin the next chance you get. Order pide or any variation of a lahmacun. Pide (5-6€) are made fresh, and depending on the time of day, lahmacun (2.2€) are reheated to a crisp in the wood-fired oven, or perhaps made fresh in front of you.
