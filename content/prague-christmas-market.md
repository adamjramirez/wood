In the many Christmas markets in Prague, you will find 3 main things cooked over a wood fire.

1. Trdlnik, a traditional baked dessert, coated in sugar and filled with various toppings
2. Prague Ham, a pork ham, salted and roasted directly over an open flame on a spit
3. Various Czech Sausages (not pictured), grilled over wood coals, from freshly split wood logs
