In the many Christmas markets in Prague, you will find 3 main things cooked over a wood fire.

1) Trdlnik, a traditional baked dessert, coated in sugar and filled with various toppings  
2) Prague Ham, a pork ham, salted and roasted directly over an open flame on a spit  
3) Various Czech Sausages (not pictured), grilled over wood coals, from freshly split wood logs
