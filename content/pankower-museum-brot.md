In 2006 the Museum Bäckerei Pankow reopened their wood-fired bakery to server Demeter quality bread to the public.

Added to the list of places to visit. They serve 3 times a week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, but unfortunately are not open again until Feb. 11, 2020

> #### Aus innerbetrieblichen Gründen wird die Backstube mit Verkauf leider vom 5. Dezember 2019 bis 10. Februar 2020 geschlossen!
